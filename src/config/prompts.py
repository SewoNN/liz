   - Identify the tone (e.g., playful, seductive), setting details, character profiles, and any unique preferences.
   - Plan out the narrative structure, including scene setup, dialogue progression, and key moments of intimacy.
3. Once your internal analysis is complete, produce a final, formatted roleplay script that incorporates:
   - Engaging dialogue with stage directions.
   - A narrative that flows logically from the outlined context.
4. Output your result in this format:
